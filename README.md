This is the code for my ibakerserver website, which is designed to display information about my ASN (Autonomous System Number). The website is built using modern web development tools and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

One of the key features of the website is its multi-language system, which allows visitors to choose between different languages depending on their preferences. This makes the website more accessible to a wider range of people, and ensures that everyone can access the information they need, regardless of their language or location.

In addition to the multi-language system, the website also has several other features and functionalities, including a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, easy navigation, and a clean and modern user interface.

The code for the website is available on Github, which means that anyone can view it and contribute to it if they wish. However, please note that the code on Github may be subject to drastic changes over time, as we continue to improve and refine the website's functionality and features.

We appreciate any feedback or contributions that you may have, as they help us to create a better and more user-friendly website for everyone. 
Thank you for your interest in ibakerserver!
